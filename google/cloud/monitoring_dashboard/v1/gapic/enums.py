    class Aligner(enum.IntEnum):
        """
        The Aligner describes how to bring the data points in a single
        time series into temporal alignment.

        Attributes:
          ALIGN_NONE (int): No alignment. Raw data is returned. Not valid if cross-time
          series reduction is requested. The value type of the result is
          the same as the value type of the input.
          ALIGN_DELTA (int): Align and convert to delta metric type. This alignment is valid for
          cumulative metrics and delta metrics. Aligning an existing delta metric
          to a delta metric requires that the alignment period be increased. The
          value type of the result is the same as the value type of the input.

          One can think of this aligner as a rate but without time units; that is,
          the output is conceptually (second_point - first_point).
          ALIGN_RATE (int): Align and convert to a rate. This alignment is valid for cumulative
          metrics and delta metrics with numeric values. The output is a gauge
          metric with value type ``DOUBLE``.

          One can think of this aligner as conceptually providing the slope of the
          line that passes through the value at the start and end of the window.
          In other words, this is conceptually ((y1 - y0)/(t1 - t0)), and the
          output unit is one that has a "/time" dimension.

          If, by rate, you are looking for percentage change, see the
          ``ALIGN_PERCENT_CHANGE`` aligner option.
          ALIGN_INTERPOLATE (int): Align by interpolating between adjacent points around the
          period boundary. This alignment is valid for gauge
          metrics with numeric values. The value type of the result is the same
          as the value type of the input.
          ALIGN_NEXT_OLDER (int): Align by shifting the oldest data point before the period
          boundary to the boundary. This alignment is valid for gauge
          metrics. The value type of the result is the same as the
          value type of the input.
          ALIGN_MIN (int): Align time series via aggregation. The resulting data point in
          the alignment period is the minimum of all data points in the
          period. This alignment is valid for gauge and delta metrics with numeric
          values. The value type of the result is the same as the value
          type of the input.
          ALIGN_MAX (int): Align time series via aggregation. The resulting data point in
          the alignment period is the maximum of all data points in the
          period. This alignment is valid for gauge and delta metrics with numeric
          values. The value type of the result is the same as the value
          type of the input.
          ALIGN_MEAN (int): Align time series via aggregation. The resulting data point in the
          alignment period is the average or arithmetic mean of all data points in
          the period. This alignment is valid for gauge and delta metrics with
          numeric values. The value type of the output is ``DOUBLE``.
          ALIGN_COUNT (int): Align time series via aggregation. The resulting data point in the
          alignment period is the count of all data points in the period. This
          alignment is valid for gauge and delta metrics with numeric or Boolean
          values. The value type of the output is ``INT64``.
          ALIGN_SUM (int): Align time series via aggregation. The resulting data point in
          the alignment period is the sum of all data points in the
          period. This alignment is valid for gauge and delta metrics with numeric
          and distribution values. The value type of the output is the
          same as the value type of the input.
          ALIGN_STDDEV (int): Align time series via aggregation. The resulting data point in the
          alignment period is the standard deviation of all data points in the
          period. This alignment is valid for gauge and delta metrics with numeric
          values. The value type of the output is ``DOUBLE``.
          ALIGN_COUNT_TRUE (int): Align time series via aggregation. The resulting data point in the
          alignment period is the count of True-valued data points in the period.
          This alignment is valid for gauge metrics with Boolean values. The value
          type of the output is ``INT64``.
          ALIGN_COUNT_FALSE (int): Align time series via aggregation. The resulting data point in the
          alignment period is the count of False-valued data points in the period.
          This alignment is valid for gauge metrics with Boolean values. The value
          type of the output is ``INT64``.
          ALIGN_FRACTION_TRUE (int): Align time series via aggregation. The resulting data point in the
          alignment period is the fraction of True-valued data points in the
          period. This alignment is valid for gauge metrics with Boolean values.
          The output value is in the range [0, 1] and has value type ``DOUBLE``.
          ALIGN_PERCENTILE_99 (int): Align time series via aggregation. The resulting data point in the
          alignment period is the 99th percentile of all data points in the
          period. This alignment is valid for gauge and delta metrics with
          distribution values. The output is a gauge metric with value type
          ``DOUBLE``.
          ALIGN_PERCENTILE_95 (int): Align time series via aggregation. The resulting data point in the
          alignment period is the 95th percentile of all data points in the
          period. This alignment is valid for gauge and delta metrics with
          distribution values. The output is a gauge metric with value type
          ``DOUBLE``.
          ALIGN_PERCENTILE_50 (int): Align time series via aggregation. The resulting data point in the
          alignment period is the 50th percentile of all data points in the
          period. This alignment is valid for gauge and delta metrics with
          distribution values. The output is a gauge metric with value type
          ``DOUBLE``.
          ALIGN_PERCENTILE_05 (int): Align time series via aggregation. The resulting data point in the
          alignment period is the 5th percentile of all data points in the period.
          This alignment is valid for gauge and delta metrics with distribution
          values. The output is a gauge metric with value type ``DOUBLE``.
          ALIGN_PERCENT_CHANGE (int): Align and convert to a percentage change. This alignment is valid
          for gauge and delta metrics with numeric values. This alignment
          conceptually computes the equivalent of "((current -
          previous)/previous)*100" where previous value is determined based on the
          alignmentPeriod. In the event that previous is 0 the calculated value is
          infinity with the exception that if both (current - previous) and
          previous are 0 the calculated value is 0. A 10 minute moving mean is
          computed at each point of the time window prior to the above calculation
          to smooth the metric and prevent false positives from very short lived
          spikes. Only applicable for data that is >= 0. Any values < 0 are
          treated as no data. While delta metrics are accepted by this alignment
          special care should be taken that the values for the metric will always
          be positive. The output is a gauge metric with value type ``DOUBLE``.
